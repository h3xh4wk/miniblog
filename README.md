Miniblog
========

NOTE - This project is still very much rough around the edges and does not include *every* feature listed below yet. (For example, this is only self-hosted for now; if there is enough interest, I may make a dedicated website for users.) Other than that, this should be considered a beta release and in no way good enough for production use. I was just excited to integrate this project into my own site to start writing blog posts.

This is my no nonsense, no friction, self hosted blogging platform. For a long time now, I have wanted to get into blogging. My problem is the large amount of bloat on most blogging websites. There's tags, comments, custom backgrounds, and loads of plug-ins among other countless customizations. Basically, there are a bunch of features to distract you from the point of blogs - reading and writing content. Because of this, I would get around to writing one, maybe two full-blown blog posts and then stop because each post took up way too much of my time making the writing experience itself fully unenjoyable. Many blogging solutions have gone from a way for people to simply express themselves to full website frameworks & editors. (Slight exaggeration but seriously, even removing all the features for the minimalist feel is usually a pain.)

A couple of months ago, I came across the idea of frictionless (yay buzzwords) blogging. These are blogs set up to focus solely on getting content out as quickly and easily as possible and that's it. You should be able to open a site, write some content, and have a link to share. So really, this idea should just be called "blogging," but I guess that would get confusing so frictionless blogging it is.

After a ton of searching, I found about three websites that ranged from outright ugly and much more friction than I would like, to a website that was just about perfect aside from some fatal flaws. Those fatal flaws are what inspired me to build upon this magical idea to create this project. Specifically addressing those flaws, here are the features I wanted included:
* a self-hosted option
* localstorage of unsubmitted posts
* full markdown formatting
* mathjax (i.e. latex formatting)
* automatic syntax highlighting
* clean links
* post searching
* an overall clean/minimalist experience
* a maximum of one "excessive" webpage for login
* mobile friendly editing (and reading)

While I do really like where this project is headed, I am working on quite a few things at the moment (and I gotta make that money!) so updates may be on the slow side. If you would like to pull my attention in this direction or just show me that you like my work, I would appreciate any donations to keep me people powered or just send me an email at ykuzma1+github@gmail.com.
