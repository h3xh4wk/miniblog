# miniblog

TLDR - AFK, I have a piece of paper and a pencil to get my thoughts outs. It should be like that at my keyboard as well.

NOTE - This project is still a work in process and as such is still subject to major changes. This release (v0-9-selfhost) is to demonstrate the main features I wanted from a blog. If there is enough interest and support, I will (and really want to) develop a public facing website as well.

### introduction
This is my no-nonsense, no-friction blogging platform. For a long time now, I have wanted to get into blogging. My problem is the large amount of bloat on [most](http://blogger.com) [blogging](http://wordpress.org/) [websites](http://blog.com/). There are tags, comments, custom backgrounds and formatting, among the loads of plug-ins and other countless customizations. Basically, there are a bunch of features to distract you from the point of blogs - reading and writing content. Because of this, I would get around to writing one or maybe two full-blown blog posts and then stop. This was because each post took up way too much of my time, making the writing experience itself fully unenjoyable. 

Don't get me wrong; some of the features I've seen (e.g. multi-author editting) are really cool, but again, these features generally just add fluff. These tools may be used by your average power-user who has been blogging since before the internet (lol), but the thing is power-users aren't representative of your average blogger, and these features serve to distract. There are [microblogs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging), but those are more [socially](http://facebook.com) [oriented](http://tumblr.com) [sites](http://twitter.com) with options to share and like and comment and follow and retweet - again too much bloat for me which is kind of funny cosidering they are "microblogs". Many blogging solutions have gone from a way for people to simply express themselves to full website frameworks & editors or are simply too convoluted to use *for blogging*. This is, of course, a ginormous exaggeration, but I prefer simplicity. AFK, I have a piece of paper and a pencil to get my thoughts outs. It should be like that at my keyboard as well.

A couple of months ago, I came across the idea of frictionless blogging (yay buzzwords). These are blogs set up to focus solely on getting content out as quickly and easily as possible, and that's it. You should be able to open a site, write some content, and have a link to share. It's like a piece of paper and a pencil. So really, this idea should just be called "blogging," but I guess that would get confusing, so frictionless blogging it is.

### purpose
After a ton of searching, I found about [three](http://throwww.com/) [frictionless](http://feathe.rs/) [websites](http://scriptogr.am/) that attempt to hold to the frictionless philosophy. Honestly, most of them came very close to what I was looking for minus a few fatal flaws. Those fatal flaws are what inspired me to build upon this magical idea of frictionless blogging to create this project. Specifically addressing those flaws, here are the features I wanted included:
* a self-hosted option
* localStorage of unsubmitted posts
* full markdown formatting
* nerd-tax (just comment out the two js files in 'view-blog.html' if you don't want it)
    * mathjax (i.e. latex formatting)
    * automatic code syntax highlighting
* clean routing
* sane, informational, shareable links
* post searching (via query string in the url)
* a maximum of one "excessive" webpage for login
* an overall clean/minimalist experience
* mobile friendly editing (and reading)

### like it?
While I do love where this project is headed, I am working on quite a few things at the moment (and I gotta make that money!) so updates may be on the slow side. If you would like to pull my attention in this direction or just show me that you like my work, I would appreciate any donations to keep me people powered. As a poor, just-graduated college student myself, I do understand if you can't or just plain don't want to donate. In that case, feel free to email me at ykuzma1+github@gmail.com for any and all comments, questions, suggestions, existential musings, whathaveyou, and whatnot.
